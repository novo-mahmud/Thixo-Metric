# Case Study: Jamuna River Reach Analysis

This directory contains the input data, processed outputs, and visualizations generated by **Thixo-Metric v1.0** for the specific field dataset analyzed during the research phase.

---

## 1. Input Dataset
**File:** `InputData_Bangladesh_River_Boreholes_50.csv`

**Description:** 
This is the raw field data source containing 50 borehole samples from the river reach. It serves as the primary reference for all calculated results in this folder.

**Key Columns:**
*   `Sample_ID`: Unique borehole identifiers.
*   `Depth_m`: Sample depth from surface (m).
*   `Undisturbed_Su` & `Remolded_Su_S0`: Shear strength parameters (kPa).
*   `PI`, `Water_Content`, `Liquid_Limit_LL`: Soil consistency parameters.
*   `is_submerged`: Hydrological condition (True/False).

## 2. Analysis Output Files

### A. Technical Discussion Report
**File:** `Technical_Discussion_Report.pdf`

**Description:** A comprehensive PDF report detailing the quantitative stability analysis derived from the input data.

**Contents:**
*   **Executive Summary:** Reach failure rates and hydraulic lag statistics.
*   **High-Risk Identification:** Table of Top 5 most critical boreholes requiring immediate reinforcement.
*   **Soil Classification Vulnerability:** Comparative analysis of CH vs. CL recovery rates.
*   **Visual Dashboard:** Embedded high-resolution plots showing recovery curves and spatial risk.
*   **Strategic Recommendations:** Calculated wait-time to achieve 95% confidence stability.

### B. Visual Dashboard
**File:** `Thixo-Metric_Dashboard.png`

**Description:** High-resolution composite visualization of the river reach stability model.

**Components:**
*   **Recovery Curves:** Individual thixotropic strength gain over time (t=0 to 90 days).
*   **Sensitivity Analysis:** Density plots comparing 'Baseline' vs. 'Flood' scenarios.
*   **Spatial Profile:** Scatter plot of Factor of Safety (FoS) vs. Depth (m), highlighting critical zones.
*   **Status Distribution:** Bar chart showing Safe vs. Critical sample counts.

### C. Analyzed Data
**File:** `Thixo-Metric_Data.csv`

**Description:** The complete calculated dataset for all samples based on the Input Data.

**Columns Included:**
*   `Sample_ID`, `Scenario`, `Calculated_Su_kPa`
*   `Recovery_Const_A` (Dynamically adjusted for LI and Submergence)
*   `Driving_Stress_kPa` (Includes Flood +10% penalty if applicable)
*   `FoS` (Factor of Safety)
